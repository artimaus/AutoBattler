# Magic and Religion System Concepts

## Magic System - Elemental Transformations

### Core Element
- **Ether**: The base element of all things

### Primary Forces (Ether transforms into)
- **Glowing** → **Obscuring** (opposing force/progression)
- **Flowing** → **Binding** (opposing force/progression)
- **Growing** → **Voiding** (opposing force/progression)

### Transcendent States
- **Oblivion**: Terminal state where all opposing forces lead
- **Dust**: Created from Oblivion, can be converted back to Ether
- **Flesh**: Special element that can convert directly to either Ether OR Oblivion

## Religion System - The Path of Deconstruction

### Core Belief
Everything begins as Ether, becomes Dust, forms Bones, grows Sinew, is enveloped in Flesh, and is imprisoned in the Body. The Body ultimately goes into Oblivion.

**Religious Goal**: Reverse this process and return to Ether.

### The Sacred Process (Stages of Deconstruction)

1. **Body** (Starting point - humans/adherents)
   - First step: Simultaneously die and reanimate yourself with Necromancy
   - This severs the connection to the Body

2. **Remove Flesh** (skin)
   - Progressive removal of flesh/skin

3. **Remove Sinew** (muscle)
   - Stripping away muscle tissue

4. **Remove Bone** (skeleton)
   - Dissolution of the skeletal structure

5. **Dust** (penultimate state)
   - Adherent becomes pure Dust

6. **Final Transcendence**
   - Obliterate the Dust you inhabit
   - (Theoretically) return to Ether

### Key Themes and Questions

- **Metaphysical uncertainty**: Even with access to magic, there's no guarantee that obliterating your Dust actually achieves transcendence or enlightenment
- **Progressive commitment**: Each stage requires increasing sacrifice and irreversible faith
- **Necromantic paradox**: Using death magic as the first step toward spiritual liberation
- **The final irony**: Must destroy your "purified" Dust state to achieve true transcendence
- **Body horror spirituality**: Physical reality creates natural conflict with other belief systems

### Future Development Notes

- How other religions/cultures react to practitioners
- Different magical abilities at different stages?
- Whether any adherent has actually succeeded or if they simply disappear
- Interaction with other religious systems (TBD)
